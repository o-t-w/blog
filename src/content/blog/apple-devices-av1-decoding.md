AV1 is the best video format for the web. It’s supported by all web browsers. However, for Safari, support depends on the hardware. Older Apple devices can’t play AV1 video on the web, even if they’re running the latest version of iOS and Safari.

In 2023, Apple unveiled their M3 chip, the first Apple chip to support AV1 decoding. The press release [read](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/#:~:text=All%20three%20chips,extend%20battery%20life.):

> All three chips in the M3 family also have an advanced media engine, providing hardware acceleration to the most popular video codecs, including H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW. And for the first time, the media engine supports AV1 decoding, enabling power-efficient playback of streaming services to further extend battery life.

2023 also saw the release of the iPhone 15 Pro, which included hardware-accelerated decoding via the A17 Pro chip.

Apple has taken a significant amount of time to upgrade its full-range of products to the latest chips. Some devices skipped the M3 and went from the M2 to the M4. Below is a list of the first Apple devices to support hardware-accelerated AV1 video decoding:
