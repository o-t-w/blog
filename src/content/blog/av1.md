AV1 is the next-gen open-source royalty-free video codec created by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), a group founded by Google, Mozilla, Cisco, Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, and Intel. Apple is also a member. 

We are finally broader hardware support for this codec.

The [iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://bitmovin.com/apple-av1-support/) featured an AV1 hardware decoder. All versions of the iPhone 16 [support AV1](https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-16/specs/#:~:text=Supported%20formats%20include%20HEVC%2C%20H.264%20and%C2%A0AV1).

 Apple's [M3 chip](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/) also added support for AV1, which has continued with the M4 chip used in the iPad Pro.  

Microsoft Edge belatedly added support for AV1 in January 2024. [All web browsers](https://caniuse.com/av1) now support AV1.
