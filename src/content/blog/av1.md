AV1 is the next-gen open-source royalty-free video codec created by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), a group founded by Google, Mozilla, Cisco, Microsoft, Netflix, Amazon, and Intel. Apple is also a member. 

We are finally seeing more hardware support for this codec. The new [M3 chips](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-unveils-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-the-most-advanced-chips-for-a-personal-computer/) from Apple support AV1 decode. The [iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max](https://bitmovin.com/apple-av1-support/) also feature an AV1 hardware decoder.

The official [Android 14 Compatibility Definition](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/14/android-14-cdd#:~:text=H%2D0%2D3%5D-,AV1,-End%20new%20requirements) makes support for AV1 mandatory. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, widely used by Android phones released in 2023, [supports AV1](https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-gen-2-mobile-platform#:~:text=Codecs%3A%20Hybrid%20Log%20Gamma%20(HLG)%2C%20HDR10%2B%2C%20AV1%2C%20H.264%20(Advanced%20Video%20Coding%20(AVC))%2C%20VP9%2C%20VP8%2C%20Dolby%20Vision%C2%AE%2C%20H.265%20(High%20Efficiency%20Video%20Coding%20(HEVC))%2C%20HDR10).

With the exception of Microsoft Edge, all browsers support AV1.
